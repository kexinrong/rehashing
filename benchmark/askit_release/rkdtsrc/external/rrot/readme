This code is based on Mark Tygert's fast SVD code 
   http://cims.nyu.edu/~tygert/software.html
I just use the fast rotations, the two files under the "src" directory.

The src/id_rtrans.f was modified to become thread safe. The original
verion is not and using it within and OpenMP loop creates
problems. I modified  idd_random_transf() and some of the routines it
calls.  On a macbook pro, comparing with LAPACK and direct roations
(including the time to factorize), the crossover dimension is rougly
d=256. 


The fortran files have been tested only with the  gfortran
compiler. ifort gives segmentation faults. By the link compiler can be
anything.
